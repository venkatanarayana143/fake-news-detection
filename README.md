# fake-news-detection
 This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with the fake and real news.   Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then we initialize a PassiveAggressiveClassifier and fit the model.   In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
